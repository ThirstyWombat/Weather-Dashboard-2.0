# Weather App built with React, TS and Tailwind

Quick recreation of an older [project](https://github.com/ThirstyWombat/Weather-Dashboard) that I created on my bootcamp using React, Typescript and Tailwin.

I used this project to quickly get back up to speed with React and Tailwind and as my first learning experience with TS.
